# Intro Machine Learning

# **The three different types of machine learning**

There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

**Machine learning terminology**

Machine learning is a vast field and also very interdisciplinary as it brings together
many scientists from other areas of research. As it happens, many terms and
concepts have been rediscovered or redefined and may already be familiar to you
but appear under different names. For your convenience, in the following list, you
can find a selection of commonly used terms and their synonyms that you may find
useful when reading this book and machine learning literature in general:

• Training example: A row in a table representing the dataset and synonymous
with an observation, record, instance, or sample (in most contexts, sample
refers to a collection of training examples).

• Training set: Model fitting, for parametric models similar to parameter
estimation. (e.g. train test split)

• Feature, abbrev. X: Matrix with columns in a data table or data (design) matrix.
Synonymous with predictor, features, variable, input, attribute, or covariate.

• Target, abbrev. y: Synonymous with outcome, output, response variable,
dependent variable, (class) label, and ground truth.

• Loss function: Often used similar to a cost function. Sometimes
the loss function is also called an error function. In some literature, the
term "loss" refers to the loss measured for a single data point, and the cost
is a measurement that computes the loss (average or summed) over the
entire dataset.
